# talk-buddy

Implement the basic chat UI for a WhatsApp-like chat app with these elements:

- A sidebar on the left showing the list of chats, with the user's profile pic and name at the top
- The main chat view on the right, which shows the current conversation 
- A text input at the bottom of the chat view to compose messages
- A header at the top of the chat view showing the name and online status of the current chat recipient

Use a modern, clean design similar to WhatsApp's UI. Hardcode some sample chat data and messages for now. We will make it dynamic later.
